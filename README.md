# Generative Art Creator

## Codecademy Project 

Media and art have been synonymous with each other for decades. For example, take historical artworks such as the [generative experiments in motion graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIv-EcX9tUs) created by the animator John Whitney or the [abstract geometrical works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r) by pioneering media artist Vera Molnar. These historical works created using early computing technology have greatly influenced art and design today.

In this project, you will have the chance to put the p5.js interaction skills youâ€™ve gained from the previous lesson to practice! You will be making a tool to create, control, and combine generative works of art inspired by these early media artists using keyboard interactions.
